# Rules
NOTE: Aethenheim has a mod that is a required install, it is part of rule enforcement and without it you cannot play on the servers.

1. The usual fanfare: I.e no cheating, hacking and other malicious stuff.
2. Do not install client side mods unless directed to. A approved list can be found in "APPROVED-CLIENT-MODS.MD"
3. Aethenheim is strictly 17+ and rated Mature.
   1. It's to get kids away from the server and not have to deal with drama or legal issues.
   2. This server is NOT a safe space or whatever nonsense you can imagine, do not play on this server if you can't deal with banter.
4. Even if it's 17+, Aethenheim is primarily about the game. It's not 2b2t, targetted harassment will not be tolerated.
5. LGBTQ Alphabhet soup is banned. Again this is not your safe space, this is my server, my rules. We are here to play a game, not
   for you to spread drama and seek attention. There's thousands of other Minecraft servers for you to play on
   if you feel the need for constant attention. Irrespective of my own opinions, I find that this crowd are only around to cause drama,
   and seek attention + have serious pedo problems.
6. Certain countries or sections of countries are banned. See the README.MD
7. Every known VPN service is banned by default. VPN's can be approved on a per-case basis where extensive proof of political persecution
   is needed, but don't count on it and VPN cases are extremly low priority.
8. Chargeback = Permban.
9. In cases of server malfunction, there will be no individual item grants.
10. Unapproved bug abuse is not tolerated. The only exception is TNT duplication.
    * TNT duplication must be kept at a moderate level, so nothing massive.
    * We reserve the right to tell you to knock it off/shut it down if impact on server is to large.
    * TNT Duplication cannot be used for the purposes of raiding other players, only for the purposes of mining and terraforming on a minor scale.
11. In PVP cases that are not part of a raid: You can only kill a player 2 times per 4 days. You are always allowed to defend yourself and kill
    them if they seek revenge.
    * In addition, it will be considered targetted harrasment if there's a clear pattern over a 6 month period of you hunting
      the same players down.
12. Requesting or sharing Dox of players leads to a permban. 

General punishment guidelines:
We operate on a Four strikes system
with a reducing strikes modifier.
Permbans are actually permanent, they cannot be appealed.

* Rules 1,2,3,5,7,8,10 and 12  leads to a permban immediatly.
* The other rules are as follows:
  * First offense, kick then 3 hour mute on login.
  * Second offense, 15 day tempban.
  * Third offense, 30 day tempban.
  * Fourth offense, permban.

We may elect to warn you instead, in that case getting another warning within 6 hours always leads to the first offense tier.

Offenses are "forgotten" after 6 months. meaning if you have commited 3 offenses, it would take
18 months to be considered just as clean as someone who has never been punished before.
