# AethenheimMC
Aethenheim is a new minor gaming community sprung forth from 
a desire to do the following:

Fix games and improve what is already there.
Our starting project is Minecraft.

Aethenheim is funded primarily by the good will of the players.
I.e there will be no P2W aspect and no special discord ranks or anything silly
like that (infact we do not have and will never have a discord, as it's a degenerate hellscape).



## Aethenheim SMP MC server

### Mission

1. Take features that Mojang have neglected, and flesh them out.
2. Rebalance the progression.
3. Enhance the Vanilla gameplay 
4. Provide a "goodwill" funded MC experience. 

### Funding

* Donations & serverwide boosts
* Donations are actually donations, you get nothing from them, you don't even get some sort of top donator leaderboards or anything.
  Every player has access to a couple of styling options for their nicknames etc.
  Anything "cosmetically" added is earned ingame by simply playing.
  I don't belivie in this stupid "flex" shit where whales expect influence and power.

* You donate purely becauser you want the server to stay alive and grow. Not because you want to gain something from it.
  To that end, every minecraft account is capped to a max of 10 USD in donations per month and a max of 2 serverboosts per month (each serverboost costs 3 USD).
  Transaction fees are not counted into this.

* Donation amounts are set to a minimum of 2 USD + transaction fees.

#### Negatives of this funding style
* Addicts and other degenerates who use money to feel important online will likely not donate, or if they do
  their attentionwhoring will cause them to beg for powers. Such things will be rejected.
* No money flexing. People who can treat 100, 200 or even 500 USD like "nothing" because they are rich asf
  don't get to flex their unwarranted self-importance using daddys creditcard. :)
  These people too are likely to also not donate.

Conclusion: IDGAF!

Now to the good stuff:

### Major changes from vanilla smp minecraft

* Tectonic generator with some minor tweaks.
* World height increased by a total of 256 blocks, with half for Deep and Half for overworld (Basically means Y-level -64 to Y-level 319 becomes Y-level -192 to Y-level 447)
** All generations stretched vertically to compensate, for example oceans are even deeper than tectonics defaults.
* Everything within 5000 x 5000 = Admin Zone. This is where events and other things take place.
* Everything after 25k to 125k = Permission based raiding. Players must agree to raid eachother. No Griefing.
* Everything
