# AethenheimMC
Aethenheim is a new minor gaming community sprung forth from 
a desire to do the following:

Fix games and improve what is already there.
Our starting project is Minecraft.

Aethenheim is funded primarily by the good will of the players.
I.e there will be no P2W aspect and no special discord ranks or anything silly
like that (infact we do not have and will never have a discord, as it's a degenerate hellscape).

The community is rated 17+. This means we do not
willingly or knowingly allow anyone under that age to play here.
If detected the minecraft account will be permbanned.
Ex: Someone at the age of 13 joins. Gets caught = Permbanned for 5 years.

The following countries or parts of countries are permabanned due to either ping
or because they are pieces of shit.

* West USA (Ping)
* Russia (naturally, it has less to do with the war and more so with Russians being annoying drunk shitheads, also because they refuse to write in English)
* France (for refusing to write in English)
* UK (For larping 1984 and because they are retarded)
* China (for not being trustworthy)
* The entirety of Africa (Ping and because of corruption)
* All muslim majority countries besides Turkey. (Religious fundementalists have no place in the digital age).
* Any other country that exceeds 130 ms to the server.

There'a a small secret variation of 1-10 seconds where a ping higher than 130 ms is tolerated.
If this happens more than 3 times in a period of 1-6 hours while connected, the user
will automatically get tempbanned (both account and IP address) for 6 hours.

If it happens again, the next ban will be 24 hours.
The third time, the ban will be 

## Aethenheim SMP MC server

### Mission

1. Take features that Mojang have neglected, and flesh them out.
2. Rebalance the progression.
3. Enhance the Vanilla gameplay 
4. Provide a "goodwill" funded MC experience. 

### Funding

* Donations & serverwide boosts
* Donations are actually donations, you get nothing from them, you don't even get some sort of top donator leaderboards or anything.
  Every player has access to a couple of styling options for their nicknames etc.
  Anything "cosmetically" added is earned ingame by simply playing.
  I don't belivie in this stupid "flex" shit where whales expect influence and power.

* You donate purely becauser you want the server to stay alive and grow. Not because you want to gain something from it.
  To that end, every minecraft account is capped to a max of 10 USD in donations per month and a max of 2 serverboosts per month (each serverboost costs 3 USD).
  Transaction fees are not counted into this.

* Donation amounts are set to a minimum of 2 USD + transaction fees.

#### Negatives of this funding style
* Addicts and other degenerates who use money to feel important online will likely not donate, or if they do
  their attentionwhoring will cause them to beg for powers. Such things will be rejected.
* No money flexing. People who can treat 100, 200 or even 500 USD like "nothing" because they are rich asf
  don't get to flex their unwarranted self-importance using daddys creditcard. :)
  These people too are likely to also not donate.

Conclusion: IDGAF!

Now to the good stuff:

Aethenheim will update to "The Copper Age" when all mods are ready for it.
After that, we will lock down Aethenheim to that version and stay up to 1 year behind.
The reason is that we depend on a bunch of mods for the changes and it's unreasonable to expect
mod authors to update constantly. Especially now when Mojang has decided to do these shitty gamedrops.
Besides, in the view of your humble founder, I think Mojang
is eating shit quite literally and both them and their overlords
at Microsoft is beyond incompetent.

For now. Aethenheim stays on Version 1.21.7

### Major changes from vanilla smp minecraft

* Tectonic generator with some minor tweaks.
* World height increased by a total of 256 blocks, with half for Deep and Half for overworld (Basically means Y-level -64 to Y-level 319 becomes Y-level -192 to Y-level 447)
* All generations stretched vertically to compensate, for example oceans are even deeper than tectonics defaults.
* Everything within 5000 x 5000 = Admin Zone. This is where events and other things take place.
* Everything after 5k to 105k = Permission based raiding. Players must agree to raid eachother. No Griefing. Unclaimed stuff are fair game.
* Everything after 105k starts dividing into sectors, where the rewards are increased ore generation, but also more danger:
  * Every 200k blocks further outwards (besides the first sector which is 195k blocks, so sector 1 is 105k to 295k, sector 2 is 200k to 400k and so on), mobs gain 1 more heart to their max health, deal half a heart more damage, and drop 5% more experience. They also
    drop 1 more of range spanning items. For example if a vanilla mob drops 3-5 feathers, in sector 1 they'd drop 3-6 feathers, in sector 2 3-7 feathers and so on.
* There are a total of 30 sectors, with the last sector beginning at 6105000+ and onwards.
* After sector 20, you do not need to ask permission to raid someone, but you cannot grief (for example you may break down doors to find a chest and steal everything).

* After 20 000 000 blocks, you arrive in the Farlands.
  * Farlands is simply a nod towards the old glitch, it's not actually a biome like that generation.
  * Farlands are a completely lawless zone.
  * The rewards are the greatest in the Farlands, and it's the only place where you can enchant weapons with Looting 4 and 5 (and other luck based enchantments)
  * In the Farlands, you can grief buildings freely. But you will find that blocks placed by players break 8 times slower (with doors being up to 12 times slower)
    * On the flipside, block damage is persistent. The blocks regenerate themselves after 30 minutes.
    * This counts for blocks you place yourself too, so be carefull.
  * Beds in the farlands break after 3 respawns.

* Mending has been nerfed with the Unmending mod.
* Anvil has been buffed and is easier to maintain.
* Elytra has been nerfed, temporarily with Firework rockets dealing 15% durability damage to the Elytra.
  * When Aileron Mod is updated, it will be used instead.

* BetterCombat and
